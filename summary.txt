(main algorithm bit)
- Calculate 1000 period rolling average of Bybit/GateIO bid and Bybit/GateIO ask prices
- Find the percentage difference of the current point from this rollong average
- For bids, if the ratio is greater than the 35th percentile, replace with the last non-outlier value
- For asks, if the ratio is less than the 65th percentile, replace with the last non-outlier value

(negative spread bit)
- Iterative algorithm to correct for negative spreads, and further outliers
- If any negative spreads remain after initial cleaning (ask/bid < 1):
  * Revert both ask and bid prices back to original values for those rows
  * Increment bid threshold by 5 and decrement ask threshold by 5 (-5)
- Calculate rolling average of bid/ask ratio using 50-point window
- Calculate rolling percentiles of this average spread using 50-point window 
- For points in bottom 5th percentile of spread:
  * Calculate mean spread from rolling average
  * symetrically increment bid and ask prices by the amount needed to match the mean spread of this rolling average

- If any negative spreads remain after this process, repeat processbut using new thresholds
- Repeat this loop 10 times
- If any negative spreads remain after this process, revert to original prices for those rows (potentially could fix, but whatever)
